## 1. **Core Git Commands**

Understanding and mastering Git’s fundamental commands is essential for any senior engineer:

- **Repository Management:**
    - `git clone`: Copy an existing repository.
    - `git init`: Initialize a new repository.
- **Status and Tracking:**
    - `git status`: Check the current state of the repository.
    - `git diff`: View changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.
- **Committing Changes:**
    - `git add`: Stage changes.
    - `git commit`: Record changes. Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **Branching and Merging:**
    - `git branch`: List, create, or delete branches.
    - `git checkout`: Switch between branches or restore working tree files.
    - `git merge`: Merge changes from one branch into another.
- **History and Logs:**
    - `git log`: View commit history.
    - `git blame`: Identify who changed what and when in a file.

## 2. **Advanced Git Commands and Practices**

For more complex workflows and troubleshooting, advanced commands come in handy:

- **Rewriting History:**
    
    - **Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`):**  
        Clean up your commit history before merging; squash, reorder, or edit commits.
    - **Amending Commits:**
        - `git commit --amend`: Update the most recent commit.
- **Undoing Changes:**
    
    - `git reset`: Move the current branch pointer to a previous commit.
    - `git revert`: Create a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit.
    - `git stash`: Temporarily save changes that are not ready to commit.
- **Cherry-Picking:**
    
    - `git cherry-pick`: Apply changes from specific commits onto your current branch.
- **Bisecting:**
    
    - `git bisect`: Perform a binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug.
- **Remote Repositories:**
    
    - `git fetch`: Download objects and refs from another repository.
    - `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote branch.
    - `git push`: Upload your local changes to a remote repository.

## 3. **Branching Strategies and Workflows**

Senior engineers should champion and enforce good branching strategies:

- **Feature Branch Workflow:**  
    Create branches for new features and keep them isolated until they’re ready to merge.
    
- **Git Flow or Trunk-Based Development:**
    
    - **Git Flow:** Uses distinct branches like `develop`, `release`, and `hotfix` to manage complex release cycles.
    - **Trunk-Based Development:** Emphasizes short-lived branches and frequent integration into the main branch.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):**
    
    - Use pull requests as the central tool for merging code.
    - Ensure each PR is accompanied by a clear description, linked issues, and well-documented changes.
    - Enforce peer reviews and use GitHub’s review features (comments, suggestions, approval requests).

## 4. **GitHub Tools and Integrations**

Beyond Git commands, GitHub offers a variety of built-in tools that help maintain a healthy development workflow:

- **Issues and Project Management:**
    
    - **Issues:**  
        Track bugs, feature requests, and tasks. Use labels, milestones, and assignees for organization.
    - **GitHub Projects:**  
        Use Kanban boards to visualize work, track progress, and manage sprints.
    - **Milestones:**  
        Group issues and PRs to plan and track progress toward specific releases.
- **Pull Request Reviews:**
    
    - Use GitHub’s code review tools to comment inline, request changes, and approve PRs.
    - Utilize draft pull requests to signal work-in-progress and invite early feedback.
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD):**
    
    - Automate workflows for testing, building, and deploying code.
    - Create custom workflows that run on push, PR creation, or issue events.
    - Enforce quality gates by integrating automated tests and linting checks.
- **GitHub Pages:**  
    Host static sites for documentation or project pages directly from your repository.
    
- **Security and Dependency Management:**
    
    - **Dependabot:**  
        Automate dependency updates and receive alerts about security vulnerabilities.
    - **Code Scanning:**  
        Use GitHub’s security features (like CodeQL) to automatically scan your code for vulnerabilities.
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`):**
    
    - Manage issues, pull requests, and repository settings directly from your terminal.
    - Automate routine tasks and integrate GitHub actions with local scripts.

## 5. **Best Practices for a Senior Engineer**

Beyond knowing the tools and commands, it’s important to instill good practices in your workflow:

- **Write Meaningful Commit Messages:**
    - Follow conventional commit guidelines (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`) for clarity.
- **Review and Enforce Code Quality:**
    - Use code reviews not just to find bugs, but also to ensure consistent style and architectural soundness.
    - Leverage linters, formatters, and automated tests as part of your CI pipeline.
- **Documentation:**
    - Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for your codebase, including README files, contribution guidelines, and API documentation.
- **Communication:**
    - Use GitHub issues and PR discussions to communicate design decisions, trade-offs, and progress.
- **Automated Testing and Continuous Integration:**
    - Ensure every commit and pull request triggers a suite of tests to catch regressions early.
    - Monitor build statuses and enforce branch protections on critical branches.
- **Regular Repository Maintenance:**
    - Periodically clean up branches, review stale issues, and ensure that dependencies are up-to-date.
- **Versioning and Releases:**
    - Use GitHub Releases to package and document production-ready versions.
    - Follow semantic versioning practices for clear communication of changes.
