# What is ERD?

- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: A visual representation that explains the relationships between entities to be stored in a database.
- It is a structural design of the database, providing a framework using specialized symbols to define the relationships between database entities.
- An ERD is created based on three main components:
  1. **Entities**: Objects or things in the database (e.g., customers, orders).
  2. **Attributes**: Characteristics or properties of entities (e.g., customer name, order date).
  3. **Relationships**: Associations between entities (e.g., a customer places an order).
# What is an ER Model?

- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**: Represents the structure of a database using a diagram to show the relationships between entities.
- **ER Modelling** is a systematic process for designing a database, requiring the analysis of all data requirements before the database implementation.

# Why Use ER Diagrams in DBMS?

- **Conceptualization**: Helps visualize the database structure and identify which fields need to be included for each entity.
- **Better Understanding**: Provides a clear view of the information to be stored in the database.
- **Reduces Complexity**: Simplifies the design process, allowing database designers to build databases quickly.
- **Description of Elements**: Helps describe database elements using Entity-Relationship models.
- **Logical Structure Preview**: Offers a preview of the database's logical structure before implementation.
