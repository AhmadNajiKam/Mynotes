> use `rustc main.rs` to compile main.rs to an executable

```
fn main() { 
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
>  It’s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.

>We can use rustfmt to format the code as in the standard style , it's already packaged and downloaded with rustc
