## Notes
> *Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)* is the most flexible category of cloud services ,  it provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources. the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security. and you're responsible for everything else.


## Shared responsibility model
#### IaaS places the largest share of responsibility with you.

## Scenarios 
* Lift-and-shift migration: You’re setting up cloud resources similar to your on-prem datacenter, and then simply moving the things running on-prem to running on the IaaS infrastructure.
- Testing and development: You have established configurations for development and test environments that you need to rapidly replicate. You can start up or shut down the different environments rapidly with an IaaS structure, while maintaining complete control.
