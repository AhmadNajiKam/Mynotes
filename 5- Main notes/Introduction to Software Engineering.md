- ## Define software engineering and explain the responsibilities of a software engineer.
 * **Software Engineering Definition**: The systematic approach to designing and developing software.
 - **Responsibilities of Software Engineers**: Includes designing, building, maintaining software systems, writing and testing code, and consulting with stakeholders.
 - **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**: A framework guiding the steps needed to develop high-quality software.
 - **Differences Between Software Engineers and Developers**: Engineers focus on the broader system, while developers implement specific functionalities.
   
- ## Discuss key advantages of applying the software development lifecycle (SDLC) when developing enterprise software.

* ***Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a systematic process for developing high-quality software within a predictable timeframe and budget. Key points include:

- **Phases of SDLC**: It includes planning, design, and development, which can be iterative.
- **History**: Developed in the mid-1960s to manage complex software projects, initially using the "waterfall method."
- **Advantages**:
    - Provides a structured process, improving efficiency and reducing risks.
    - Clearly defined phases enhance communication among stakeholders.
    - Allows for iteration, accommodating changing requirements.
    - Clearly defined roles for team members reduce conflicts.

- ## Describe each phase of the SDLC
1. **Planning**: Requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented. Prototypes may be created to clarify requirements.
2. **Design**: The software architecture is developed based on the requirements, and a design document is created.
3. **Development**: Coding begins using the design document, with tasks assigned to developers.
4. **Testing**: The code is tested for stability and security, with bugs reported and fixed.
5. **Deployment**: The application is released to users, often in stages.
6. **Maintenance**: Post-deployment, feedback is collected, and any issues or enhancements are addressed.

- Analyze common software engineering processes required for building-high quality software.
* **Requirements Gathering**: Collecting and documenting software requirements, including functional and non-functional categories.
- **Design**: Transforming requirements into a structured solution that developers can implement.
- **Coding for Quality**: Following coding practices to ensure maintainability, readability, and efficiency.
- **Testing**: Verifying that the software 2er acceptance).
- **Releases**: Different types of software releases (alpha, beta, general availability) for various audiences.
- **Documentation**: Providing both technical and user documentation to explain software functionality.
- Explain the requirement gathering process.
- Differentiate between a User Requirement Specification (URS), a Software Requirement Specification (SRS), and a System Requirement Specification (SysRS) document.
- Compare and contrast waterfall, V-shape model, and agile methods of software development.
- Distinguish between functional, non-functional, and regression testing.
- Identify and describe different types of documentation.
- Compare and contrast the common roles and responsibilities on a software engineering project.
