# Big ideas
* ### Reliability 
- ### Predictability
- ### Performance and cost



## Details 
* Reliability: it's the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
*
*
* Reliability is one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
# Random notes
> Cloud is decentralized , u can design your solution to take advantage of that automatically , so if a server in a region fall down because of a catastrophe , other servers in other regions will work instead.

>Predictability : performance and cost predictability are heavily influenced by the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

>Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.

Autoscaling , loadbalancing , high availability are defined in the reference site.

>Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. U can use analytics to predict future costs and adjust as needed , using tools like` Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator` to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.
